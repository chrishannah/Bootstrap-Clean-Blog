# Bootstrap-Clean-Blog

If you go to the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> website, you will find that there is a very similar template you can download. That's because the design i'm uploading here is just an adaptation of the original design, that was created by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a>.

I've adapted it to my own style, and I think it's a bit more clean and I always love a single accent colour, so red it is!
