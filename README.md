# Bootstrap Blog Design

If you go to the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> website, you will find that there is a very similar template you can download. That's because the design i'm uploading here is just an adaptation of the original design, that was created by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a>.

I've adapted it to my own style, and I think it's a bit more clean and I always love a single accent colour, so red it is!

If you want to see how it looks with the example.html, either rename one of the stylesheets to "style.css", or rename the stylesheet that is being linked in the .html file.
